# ML-Decision-Tree-and-Random-Forest-Project-Python
This is a project in which I am using decision trees and random forest to predict the likely of a borrower paying back to the lender. The idea of this project was to compare the accuracy of both decision tree and random forest. It is interesting to see how random forest can perform better overall, but decision tree can still have more accuracy in some features. With this beings said, the business domain knowledge is appropriate to dinnertime which feature will be the desired one or better one to optimized in order to select the best algorithm
